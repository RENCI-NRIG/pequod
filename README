Pequod is a command-line shell tool for managing ORCA actors. Most of the help is available in the application.

To build (unless installing from RPM).

$ mvn clean package 

Then run with 
$ sh target/appassembler/bin/pequod

First time you run it will give you a template for a properties file to put in $HOME/.pequod/

$ ant install

will push it to geni-images.

Pequod comes with a pequod-check script which will update your existing installation to the latest available on-line.
