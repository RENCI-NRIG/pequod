set subcommand

	# current - set current container, actor, slice or reservation to specific values
	# or the result of the previous 'show' command. 
	# Omitting the last parameter sets value to the result of the last show command (show containers,
	# show actors, show slices, show reservations), which could be a single value or a list.
	# Note that slices and reservations require a GUID, not a name.
